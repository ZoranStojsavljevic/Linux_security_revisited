Linux-PAM (short for Pluggable Authentication Modules which evolved from the Unix-PAM architecture)
is a powerful suite of shared libraries used to dynamically authenticate a user to applications (or
services) in a Linux system.

It integrates multiple low-level authentication modules into a high-level API that provides dynamic
authentication support for applications. This allows developers to write applications that require
authentication, independently of the underlying authentication system.

Many modern Linux distributions support Linux-PAM (hereinafter referred to as “PAM”) by default.
